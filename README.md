# dotfiles
Here live most of my dotfiles.

You'll need both the base xmonad and the extra contrib libraries installed, as well as xmobar.
I use yeganesh as an alternative launcher to dmenu.

org-babel-tangle will tangle all code blocks and place the resulting files in the default
locations.
WARNING: this will overwrite your current configurations!

Press C-u C-c C-v t to tangle only the block (file) under the curser.
